                <li><h4>Interested in...</h4></li>
                <p>Nowadays, with the advancement of our general public, Information Technology (IT) appears to happen wherever around our everyday existence. Its application is utilized in practically all fields like Technology, Social media, Transportation, Building, and so on, thus, it is irrefutable that IT is an imperative piece of our cutting edge life. Truly, I am truly keen on website architecture and game turn of events. I have taken in a course about front-end and presently I am concentrating on a full-stack course to be prepared for projects from now on. As a matter of fact, when I was youthful, I truly prefer to mess around on the PC and associate with my companion through web-based entertainment like Zing Me of Vina Game and Yahoo Messenger. I generally ask myself how might it work, how we can associate with everybody just by an application or a site, and numerous different inquiries. Also, I got an opportunity to learn Informatics in Secondary and High School and I had been instructed about Pascal Programming and openness to the principal code. I observed that it is an interesting field and I began to figure out data about it. What's more, Steve Jobs, a fellow benefactor of Apple Inc., is the persuasive individual for me in this field. As should be visible, Apple is one of the biggest data innovation domains on the planet. What's more, to construct achievement like today, Apple overall and Steve Jobs specifically, needed to go through a lot of disappointments. I respect his ability and tolerance. He was even terminated from Apple in 1985, yet after 11 years he got back to run Apple and turned into a legend. Also, I feel exceptionally upset about his passing. Notwithstanding, he has made an extremely magnificent history on Apple's advancement way.</p>

                <li><h4>Personalities</h4></li>
                <p>One might say that I am an outgoing individual and continuously willing and committed to helping other people. Furthermore, my inner self isn't excessively huge, so I generally tune in and ingest everybody's ideas. That should be visible as my solid moment that working in gatherings. Since when you work in a group, tuning in and retaining input is something critical for you to address your missteps and work on yourself. Moreover, I will assist with peopling when they need it and I feel eager to assist them. Nonetheless, my drawback is as a rule excessively magnanimous and sympathetic towards individuals. I think since I regularly let my feelings overpower my explanation, I frequently stay away from words that influence individuals' feelings. Being too delicate will make it simpler for me to feel for the errors that individuals make, which will incidentally make everybody in the group unreliable and influence the general result of the group. Accordingly, I want to get a grip on my feelings and work all the more judiciously. I believe, assuming that I work in a group, I can be the individual who interfaces with individuals and resolves clashes in the quietest manner. In addition, I will likewise tune in and ingest new information from everybody, I think this will assist us with come by great outcomes. I will do whatever it takes not to allow my feelings to overpower my explanation so I can all the more likely take care of the issue</p>
