                <p>All things considered, I have joined a Front-end course with the goal that I have a tad of involvement with website architecture and web programming. I can program a fundamental site with JavaScript and use CSS, Bootstrap. Notwithstanding, I concede that my shortcoming is Back-end and information base, so I will make an honest effort to move along. Also, presently I am learning internet-based courses about programming to rehearse and further develop my programming abilities. Besides, I additionally begin to get familiar with another dialect, French. I figure it will be valuable for my future work and this time is appropriate for me to get familiar with another dialect. Likewise, I am additionally intrigued by music and cooking, as well. Subsequent to contemplating or in my available energy, I generally play a few tunes on the guitar as well as cook for my loved ones. Also, I regularly read books about existence and about creating abilities. Also, later on, I need to turn into an expert website specialist and game engineer.</p>

                <li>Education</li>
                <p>In reality, I had learned at the Ho Chi Minh University of Technology for a very long time, and I concentrated on Computer Science. The program that I examined is that I would concentrate on 2 years in Viet Nam and 2 years in Australia, nonetheless, on account of the flare-up of Covid-19, I can't finish the arrangement. And afterward, I looked for data about the Information Technology major at RMIT University and I observed that excessively fascinating, so I chose to apply to RMIT University. I believe that is the best choice in my life. At the point when I came to RMIT, I feel that I can further develop a ton about my own abilities, for example, self-study, cooperation, decisive reasoning as well as this is an appropriate climate for me to improve and become familiar with English. What's more, I trust in the following 3 years in RMIT, I can foster myself and accomplish more significant things. <br><br>
                At the point when I moved to RMIT, I felt that the approach to instructing and learning at RMIT was generally excellent, it assisted me with creating myself in the most ideal way. After 2 semesters at the school, I can say that I have found numerous opportunities for myself. During my examinations, I truly need to find a gathering of companions with that we can cooperate and uphold each other in learning. Furthermore, I additionally need through what I have realized during my investigations, I can incorporate it and make my own activities. I need the school to set out more open doors for understudies to rehearse as well as apply information in genuine ventures. I can attempt to retain the information that the speaker grants in the most ideal way. Moreover, I likewise want to concentrate further in the wake of moving on from a 3-year college, and if conceivable, I might want to remain at RMIT to instruct after graduation.</p>

                <li>Awards</li>
                <p>Since I do not have much experience in the Information Technology industry, it seems that I do not have any awards in this field. I will try to have more opportunities to express myself and achieve more in the IT industry.</p>
